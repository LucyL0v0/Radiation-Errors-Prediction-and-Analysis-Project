# Automated Radiation Oncology Medical Error Labeling Project

Medical errors are a critical concern contributing to patient safety issues, often leading to adverse outcomes. This project aims to address the challenge of automating the labeling and categorization of medical errors using data collected from the assigned radiation oncology center.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop and implement a supervised classification model leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and potentially other statistical algorithms. By automating the labeling and categorization of medical errors, we aim to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of error detection, contributing to improved patient safety within the radiation oncology domain.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Collection:** Gather comprehensive data from the radiation oncology center, encompassing a diverse range of cases and error scenarios.
- **Supervised Classification:** Develop a robust classification model that can automatically label and categorize medical errors based on the collected data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Explore and apply NLP techniques to extract valuable insights from textual data, enhancing the model's ability to understand and classify errors.
