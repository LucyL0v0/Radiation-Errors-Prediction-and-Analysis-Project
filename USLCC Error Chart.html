USLCC Data for Analysis
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset represents the Error Master Chart from the USLCC Center. Each observation represents one error event that occurred during the process of Radiation Oncology following the treatment and is identified by a unique ID. Each observation includes some collected data in the form of a free text field, an identification date, the role of the identifying individual, the treatment intent, and the treatment method. The category classifies each observation that the error event falls into, represented by the BroadCat variable. BroadCat is a collapsed super category into four levels from the original ten levels of the event category and represents which part of the radiotherapy process the error occurred in. For the sake of proper statistical analysis, the records with a super-category of &quot;Treatment&quot; have been removed as there were too few records to provide any predictive power. This data was consolidated by RadPhysics Services LLC and cleaned by NCSU ST495 Team B to create a classification model that will classify an error event by the Error Category that it should fall into, using the features included in the dataset.
